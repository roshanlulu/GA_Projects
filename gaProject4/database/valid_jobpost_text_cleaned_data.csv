The 3D Visualisation Aesthetics Lab (#3DVAL) is an interdisciplinary research lab that explores arts-led approaches to visualising data. The team uses the creative methodologies and narrative approaches seen in the video games film visual effects (VFX) and interaction design fields to challenge established aesthetics.  The lab is a custom build facility at UNSW Art & Design consisting of 3D visualisation workstations virtual reality (VR) suite and render farm. It brings together arts-led researchers biomedical scientists clinical imaging professionals 3D CGI artists real-time developers and health service researchers.  About the role This is an exciting new research collaboration between UNSW Art & Design and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. The project aim is to create high quality 3D Virtual Reality (VR) outputs to increase understanding of concepts related to molecular structures and cellular genomics. These outputs will be designed for public engagement of scientific processes. The primary goal of this role is to generate VR models from molecular data that users can experience on the HTC Vive platform.
