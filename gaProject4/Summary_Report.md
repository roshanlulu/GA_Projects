## Summary Report of Project Job Postings
- Submitted by Roshan Lulu

### Summary

The aim of this project is to investigate the trend in Jobs related to Data Science, Data Analysts, Business Intelligence and Business Analysts. The main focus is to find key features that help to distinguish Salary scale, Job Titles , Industry among the different Jobs that have been selected. The report will detail the findings of this project that used Data modelling and Machine learning techniques to come up with results.

### Introduction

Over the past few years, there has been a massive increase in the demand for Data Science jobs. Recent changes in our organisation and decisions from upper management have led to creating a core data science team in our organisation. It would also be of interest to check if the data scientists in our IT industry is different from other industries.

With this study, I am expecting to find key features that distinguish a Data science job from others. This would be a key to creating a Job Description for our new role. The Human Resources team has been researching on the salary ranges to help in their budgeting for the year. 

### Methods
The Job postings that have been analysed were scraped from a Job aggregator called Seek.com. Since my organisation has branches in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, Jobs pertaining to these locations were chosen. The study is based on 2000 Job postings collected during a 24 hour period.     

### Inference

Given below is a summary of the job study:

1. Skills that distinguish Data Scientists and Analysts from other jobs are:
    - 'data science', 'data analyst', 'business intelligence', 'data analytics', 'data reporting', 'data driven', 'best practices'

2. What are the key factors/skills/keywords for Data Science jobs?
    - Skills: 'advanced excel', 'complex data','data science','machine learning', 'big data','power bi','data integration', 'excellent communication skills', 'market leader','problem solving', 'data management','management skills', 'development implementation', 'written communication',tertiary qualifications', 'requirements gathering','business needs','stakeholder management',business requirements',
    - Key job positions: 'data analyst','data scientist','data modelling', 'data warehouse','data analysis','business analysts',high performing', 'business intelligence',
           
    - Experience: 'previous experience', 'seeking experienced', 'best practice', 'proven experience', 'strong experience','experience working', 'demonstrated experience','extensive experience', 'extensive experience' 
            

### Conclusion
Data Science is a very new industry so direct predictions could not be made for the salary. However, the skills and salary ranges for the Data Science/Analysts in the industry are quite distinct. The following improvements to the study can provide better insights.

1. The lack of valid salary data was a setback for the Salary prediction. It is expected since this is an upcoming industry and the Salaries have not been standardised. As a next step, more job posts with valid salaries can be gathered over time to analyse in the next phase.

2. This phase concentrated on extracting the keywords from various Job descriptions by advertisers. Though key words have been extracted and accuracy checked, identified and known keywords need to be checked against the various facors like salary, seniority, industry.
