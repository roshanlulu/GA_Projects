- Natural language processing (NLP) helps computers understand human speech and language.
- NLP concepts
- The goal of natural language processing is to help computers understand human speech in order to do away with computer languages like Java, Ruby, or C all together. With natural language processing, computers would be able to directly under
stand human language and speech.
- NLP is a key component of artificial intelligence (AI) and relies on machine learning, a specific type of AI that analyzes and makes use of patterns in data to improve a program’s understanding of speech.
- Machine translation: Natural language processing is increasingly being used for machine translation programs, in which one human language is automatically translated into another human language.

- Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that helps computers read and respond by simulating the human ability to understand everyday language. 
- NLP tries to match keywords to a context. 
Context could include a lot of things - social media, large sets of data, formats, text analytics.

- There is a significant benefit to be had from merging NLP with data analysis. 
- Being able to accurately analyze increasing amounts of unstructured data, like emails, text messages or voice calls would lead to more accurate insights into human behavior, especially when combined with other structured data
- For example, there is tremendous potential in using this type of technology to improve the success of sales calls. Managers could monitor sales calls and learn the right variables, whether words, or tones, that help predict whether or not a call will close with a sale. That information can then be used in future calls to improve the overall success rate.

- the key stumbling block here is that computers understand "unambiguous and highly structured" programming language, while human language is a minefield of nuance, emotion, and implied intent
- Computers do many things faster and more efficiently than the human brain, but they're decidedly inferior when it comes to extracting meaning from human language

- Chatbots can already read you the news, order you a takeaway, or hail you a cab. Now they're heading for your kitchen
- “Natural language processing means that an AI is taught to interpret the content of phrases and sentences,” says Hood. “It does that through training, rather than just being told this is what these things mean.
- “Rather than telling something how to solve a problem, you tell it that you have the problem and then it learns how to solve it itself.”
- Alexa adapts better to your individual speech through each interaction thanks to machine learning. The more data it has to analyse, the greater the variety of tailored answers it has reserved.

- NLP = building systems that can understand language ⊊ AI
ML = building systems that can learn from experience ⊊ AI
NLP ⋂ ML = building systems that can learn how to understand language

- Machines are like babies learning how to talk. In order to learn something new, they need people to tell them what’s right and what’s wrong. 
- Is it gender-color-product-size pattern like in “men’s black shoes size 11?” Or is it color-occasion-product pattern like in “purple party dress?” Once Season knows the answer, she makes adjustments in our dictionary of products and attributes, so the machine knows it, too.

- Different steps for Text analytics and the tools that are used
- There are several open source projects that address various natural language processing needs written in Python, R and Java. These libraries offer reusable code and models for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and named entity recognition as shown in the table.

Tips:
Do not overload with info or text



#### Slide 2
## Heading 
- How is NLP and DataScience related?
## Key points to be covered:- 
- Machines are like babies learning how to talk. In order to learn something new, they need people to tell them what’s right and what’s wrong. 
- Machines and humans make for a powerful team

- Customer call center data classification based on the speech to text conversions, check for keywords and put into 3 categories - exiting, downgrading, upgrading


 1. NLP is analogous to a baby
 2. In order to learn something new, they need people to tell them what’s right and what’s wrong.


The introduction will give an entry.
But then how do they do it?
Problem: 
- computers understand "unambiguous and highly structured" programming language
- human language is a minefield of nuance, emotion, and implied intent

Solution:
- Data Scientist super heroes come to the rescue

You teach the computers 


## What am I trying to convey here
- How is it done on a lower level
